My name is Maria and I was born in Valencia. I decided to study a degree 
in Telematics Engineering inspired by my brother who was studying computering.

During my professional life I have worked with different programming languages such Java, 
Perl, Javascript or Python and used different frameworks like Spring Boot, React and Django.

Lately I have worked with docker and different kind of databases both relational and document-oriented.
