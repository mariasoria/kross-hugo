      content: "Maria is the sunshine you'd like to have in the team.
        Her energy, passion and hunger for growth is contagious. When I was raising to her the requirements,
        she listened and focused to understand what needs / expectations she is supposed to fulfill while writing the code.
        She consulted ad-hoc or in regular meetings to ensure she's on the right track. She was often providing recommendations
        how to do things differently which was very valuable. Maria is very communicative and social person. She's got experience
        also from theater and talking to people is not a big deal for her. I almost envy her how many friends she's got all around the world.
        If you give her a job, take care of her and keep her engaged, she will for sure be a true asset for the company sharing all the smile and energy and knowledge with everybody."

      designation: "IBM, Accounts Receivable Transformation & RPA Project Manager"
      content: "I was very lucky to work with María in IBM and I can only say good
        things about her. María is a “rara avis”, an uncommon kind of person: young and extremely well prepared. She is one of
        the most professional and organized persons I have ever met. A natural leader that not only leads by example, but with
        her charm and charisma she is able to raise a team to excellence. She is always willing to help with a smile on her face
        any colleague in need professional support, sharing knowledge or giving advice. Her adaptability to new environments is
        remarkable, a natural comfort zone avoider. I remember working with her in one particular workshop where she was able to
        make a team of four people to deliver three automation solutions (discovery + development) in just one week. In summary,
        any department/company would be proud to have María among its employees."

      content: "Maria is a very knowledgeable person with whom I had the pleasure to work with. Her ability to learn, adopt
        and leverage best of new technology is amazing. Something to highlight is that besides the technical knowledge, the
        passion for development and new technology is also that she is a trustworthy, loyal, and a hard-worker! It was a
        privilege having worked alongside Maria."

      designation: "IBM, Advisory Technical Specialist"
      content: "I had the pleasure to work with Maria during an agile workshop held in Madrid and what immediately
        popped up about her is a T shaped strong technical preparation mixed to a marked social attitude and impressive
        communication skills. She was leading a small team of Java developers in a context of automation delivery tasks
        and the accomplishments I've witnessed during the workshop were efficient, punctual and impressive due to her
        ability to listen at client needs, design java based solutions and finally deliver it in an agile fashion through
        daily continuous integration cycles. Remarkable are the ability to set right good climate within agile teams and
        the strength to digest and translate requirements into deliverables by always advising about technolody adoption
        pros and cons. Maria is a true talent it really worths to work with and which I would warmly recommend as a key
        actor within a technology agile team."

      designation: "Dell, Automation specialist"
      content: "Maria is a person that combines excellent attitude and social skills with very good technical skills
        (proficient in Java - and more recently working in Web applications with Node.JS/Angular). I am proud that I had
        her in my team for more than 1,5 years. During her tenure with us she was very punctual, responsible and proactive.
        Maria worked in projects as a Java Developer in different IBM lines of business serving a population of 1,500 employees
        and always delivered. Colleagues, project managers and product owners were always happy to work with her. Due her great
        performance, she was also assigned to work in projects in other IBM Centers (Madrid and Dublin) as a lead developer.
        In these, she had to deliver -usually in short time- solutions to improve productivity. Maria's energy, positive
        attitude and willingness to help others will be greatly missed in my team. As a team member or a leader,
        she definitely earns my highest recommendation."
